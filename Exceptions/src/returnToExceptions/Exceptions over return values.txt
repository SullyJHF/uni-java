Advantages of using exceptions over return values
- make the code more readable
  for example new IllegalArgumentException("empty strings not allowed") makes more sense than the value -1;

- Can't really ignore them
  it will crash your program if left alone
  whereas return codes can just be ignored

- Easily propagated up from deeply nested functions
  for example a function that calls another function which is called by another function
  would need many parameters passed back again and again if using return values
  however an exception automatically goes up the tree to be caught
