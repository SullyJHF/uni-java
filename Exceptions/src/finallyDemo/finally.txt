It seems that the finally block gets run first however,

1. The try block gets executed
2. the return value is set to 1
3. the finally block is then executed and the string printed to the console
4. then the call goes back to the println statement and prints the return value

When there is also a return value in the finally block that gets put in between steps 3 and 4
and the return value is set to that value, OVERRIDING the already set return value
so step 4 actually prints the newly set return value from the finally block
